Give the developer time to respond. Acting and expressing demands as if you are the customer or as if the developer is your personal assistant or employee is not a good way to ask for support. In fact, there is very little tolerance for such kind of behavior. Please, do not do it. Fixing all potential issues is just a matter of good collaboration."
